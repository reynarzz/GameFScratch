    // Body State
    // The body state is designed for fast conversion to and from SIMD via scatter-gather.
    // Only awake dynamic and kinematic bodies have a body state.
    // This is used in the performance critical constraint solver
    //
    // The solver operates on the body state. The body state array does not hold static bodies. Static bodies are shared
    // across worker threads. It would be okay to read their states, but writing to them would cause cache thrashing across
    // workers, even if the values don't change.
    // This causes some trouble when computing anchors. I rotate joint anchors using the body rotation every sub-step. For static
    // bodies the anchor doesn't rotate. Body A or B could be static and this can lead to lots of branching. This branching
    // should be minimized.
    //
    // Solution 1:
    // Use delta rotations. This means anchors need to be prepared in world space. The delta rotation for static bodies will be
    // identity using a dummy state. Base separation and angles need to be computed. Manifolds will be behind a frame, but that
    // is probably best if bodies move fast.
    //
    // Solution 2:
    // Use full rotation. The anchors for static bodies will be in world space while the anchors for dynamic bodies will be in local
    // space. Potentially confusing and bug prone.
    //
    // Note:
    // I rotate joint anchors each sub-step but not contact anchors. Joint stability improves a lot by rotating joint anchors
    // according to substep progress. Contacts have reduced stability when anchors are rotated during substeps, especially for
    // round shapes.
